### Language Evolution Simulation with ABMs

A port of fatiherikli’s language evolution simulation. Mostly I’m just playing 
around. So far, I have converted most of the code to use es6 classes, so this version won’t 
be working on any cellphones straight away.

I also hope to work on more realistic models of linguistic change. (`compoundWith`… not so much.)
